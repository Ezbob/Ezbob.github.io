                    Hi, and thanks for dropping by my site!
                    I'm Anders Busch (also known as Ezbob); a computer scientist by education, and a curious programmer by nature.

                        <p>
                            I have been fiddling with a new Domain Specific Language called "DynamoLang" that extends my
                            master thesis' Python library that handles different simulation libraries under a unifying
                            interface. The goal of this DSL is to create a language with simple syntax, so that users
                            can describe a chemical reaction models and the means to solve them on a file-per-file basis.

                            This page is generated by compiling different markdown to one index HTML file. Using Python
                            it was really easy to create a "compiler" that reads some HTML template and inserts some
                            compiled markdown into that template.
